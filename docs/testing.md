# Testing

## Approach

Testing in Wax is **agent-driven** — AI agents participate in the test authoring and execution cycle, not just humans. Tests should be machine-readable and machine-runnable, with intent expressed through their structure.

## Unit vs E2E

**Unit tests** target the service layer — business logic isolated from HTTP and the database, with dependencies injected so they can be substituted. They're cheap, fast, and the right place for any non-trivial logic that can be exercised without crossing a boundary.

**E2E tests** drive the real application through a browser using Playwright. Because Wax renders server-side HTML and uses HTMX for interactivity, e2e is the primary way to verify the full stack works together from a user's perspective. When in doubt: if a behaviour crosses the templ boundary, it belongs in e2e.

## BDD style

E2E scenarios are expressed in terms of user-observable behaviour rather than implementation details. Feature files in `e2e/feat/` read as plain English; the spec in `e2e/spec/` is the mechanical realisation. This keeps scenarios readable by non-engineers and keeps intent legible to agents generating or reviewing them.

## The e2e gate

`task test/e2e` (with `task dev` in another terminal) must pass before considering a test or change done. There are no static checks — the suite-wide rules (feature ↔ spec pairing, no orphan testids, selector discipline, no fixed-timeout waits, single auth path, real backend) are documented in [`e2e/README.md`](../e2e/README.md) and [`e2e/CLAUDE.md`](../e2e/CLAUDE.md) and honored by hand.

## Unit test conventions

Go tests use the standard library. Conventions:

- **Always write tests for new logic.** Any non-trivial function should have a corresponding test.
- **Extract pure logic from `cmd` packages** into a separate file (e.g. `pull.go`) so it can be unit tested without I/O — keep `main.go` as thin orchestration only.
- **Group tests by the function under test** using a top-level `Test<FuncName>` function. Use `t.Run` subtests to describe specific behaviours — output is scannable and the subtest names double as documentation.
- **Name subtests as plain descriptions** of the expected behaviour (e.g. `"returns empty for nonsense query"`).
- **Test behaviour, not implementation.** Each subtest asserts one specific outcome.
- **`t.Skip` is appropriate for unit tests** whose conditions may legitimately not be met (e.g. dataset-dependent assertions). This is the opposite of the e2e rule, where missing required data must fail loudly — the contexts differ.

## Dev flow

Testing is part of the development loop, not a separate phase. When a feature is built or changed, the corresponding unit and e2e tests are written or updated as part of the same change.

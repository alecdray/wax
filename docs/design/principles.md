# Design Principles

Cross-cutting rules that apply to every archetype. These describe what is already true of the codebase — a principle lands here when it lands in the code, not before.

## Server renders HTML; HTMX drives interaction

The interaction model is server-rendered HTML over HTMX, not client-rendered components. Forms submit with `hx-post` / `hx-put` and the server responds with an HTML fragment. Page navigation uses `hx-boost` on the body so links morph the relevant region instead of full-page reloading. JavaScript is reserved for genuinely client-only state (Alpine `x-data` for ephemeral UI state); it is not the medium for fetching, validating, or transforming domain data.

## Fragments over pages

When only a slice of the UI needs to change, the handler returns a fragment, not a full page. A fragment swaps into the existing DOM; a full page re-renders everything. The fragment is the reusable unit (see [archetypes/fragment-templ.md](archetypes/fragment-templ.md)); a page templ wraps a fragment in the shared layout when the same content is also reachable directly by URL.

## Errors render inline, in place

When a request fails in a way the user can recover from, the server returns an error component scoped to the relevant region — not a redirect, not a global alert, not a banner on the next page. The error appears where the action was taken. The mechanism is `httpx.HandleErrorResponse` plus an error templ component sized to the swap target.

## DOM ids belong to the templ that owns the region

If a templ defines a region that HTMX targets by id, the id-generating helper lives next to that templ (same file or its `.go` sibling). Callers obtain the id by calling the helper, not by hard-coding the string. The templ stays the single source of truth for what its swap target is named.

## Every templ root carries a testid

Every templ component's top-level root element carries a `data-testid` derived from the component name. The testid is the stable selector for tests, for `hx-target="closest [data-testid='...']"`, and for ad-hoc tooling — it does not depend on Tailwind classes that change with styling. The naming rules and the OOB/dual-use cases are in [testids.md](testids.md).

## OOB swap regions are defined once

A region that is the target of an OOB swap is defined in exactly one shared templ component. Both the initial render and the OOB response render through that component, with the OOB caller setting `hx-swap-oob="true"` via an `isOOB` parameter. This keeps the region's id, class, testid, and structure single-sourced — drift between the two render paths is otherwise invisible until the moment of the swap. The mechanics and the OOB-only-element case are in [oob-swaps.md](oob-swaps.md).

## Theme tokens, not raw colors

Styling uses the DaisyUI theme tokens defined in `static/src/main.css` (`bg-base-100`, `text-primary-content`, `border-accent`, etc.), not hex literals or one-off CSS variables in markup. When a new color is needed, it is added to the theme as a semantic token, not embedded inline at the call site.

The text emphasis scale is `text-default`, `text-muted`, `text-subtle`, `text-ghost`; the element-state utilities are `.is-disabled`, `.hover-fade-out`, and `.hover-fade-in`. Raw `text-base-content/NN` and raw `opacity-NN` should not appear in templ markup outside these utilities. See `design-system.md` for the role of each utility and `static/CLAUDE.md` for the definitions.
